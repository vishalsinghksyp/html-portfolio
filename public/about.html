<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Vishal Singh, a passionate and dedicated B.Tech student in Computer Science Engineering at Sharda University, Greater Noida. With a strong foundation in Java programming and exceptional problem-solving skills, I am constantly exploring innovative ways to develop efficient and scalable software solutions.</p>

<p>Over the years, I've honed my expertise in web development using modern technologies like ReactJS, Node.js, and MongoDB. My journey includes building impactful projects such as NewsMonkey, a real-time news application, and Ashprint, an IoT-enabled automated printer system for which I have applied for a patent.</p>

<p>Beyond academics and projects, I actively contribute to platforms like LeetCode and CodeChef, refining my coding skills and competing in problem-solving challenges.</p>

<p>When I'm not coding, I enjoy experimenting with new tools, learning emerging technologies, and working on projects that combine creativity with functionality. My goal is to build solutions that leave a meaningful impact.</p>
